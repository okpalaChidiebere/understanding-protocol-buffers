/*Most things in protocol are labeled as a message
Protocol has a serialization sequence where for every property(or keyName for JSON), you label it with the position. This is where protocol maintains its compatibility as you upgrade your file*/

/*A protofile is a schema definition of your structured data or messages
You as a developer have the responsibility to convert the protofile to the language of choice with your classes. In our case, it is Javascript
Google built a compiler called protoC where you input your protofile and what language you want to transpile to and you get your protoFile converted to the desired language eg C++, Python, Js, Go, etc */
/*One good thing about protocol is that it is a neutral language. There is built in tool by google that converts this protocol to any programming language you want*/
